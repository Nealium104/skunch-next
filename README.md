# ðŸ‘‹ Hi Skunch
This is the github profile you can check in on. We're building in public as a way to show off what we do and explain the process. If you'd like to see the current build (remember, we're still in progress!) then you can check out skunch.vercel.app.

# ðŸ‘‹ Other Devs
This is a project underway for the local Lexington band "Skunch". They're awesome! This is a collaborative project for both myself and cnl-95 to work on. We have a lot of ambitious stuff planned like a limited forum project integrated with the blog aspect of the site, a Strapi CMS for the band to use, and React-Spring for animations. Skunch is going for a retro 90's look in the About section. They've got a very distinct style in all their marketing, so we hope we can live up to their design. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
